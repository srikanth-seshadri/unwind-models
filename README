Directory hierarchy.

- There are public and private directories at the top level - where public
Models are free to be shared by all while private ones could be monetized.
- Under these we have split the Models based on the OS. Examples ios_xr,
ios_xe and so on. Under each OS we've split them as PI and a set of platforms
supported by the OS.
- Under this, we're envisioning a flat hierarchy as we have the ability for
each team to manage their meta data seprately in their own file (or have
as many as they like).
- The files themselves are typically named as "unwind_meta_compname.json".
- In a given directory, obviously there can't be any duplicate files.
- Use the GUI to add a new Model file under an existing OS/Platform.
- If you want to create a new OS, Platform, then create those directories
  manually and create the first Model file manually. You can copy an empty
  template from $unwind_base/unwind/unwind/templates/unwind_meta_default.json
  as unwind_meta_newcomp.json. After this, restart the unWind! Backend and
  the new OS/Platform should appear as a choice.
